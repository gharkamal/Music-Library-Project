# Music-Library-Project

This project implements a algorithm similar to a treemap and the tester can allow you to see the effiency on
insertion and deletions occur. 

This simple program allows an individual to insert lists of different musical albums and be able to compress an album. Those 
albums can be printed in either reverse or in order. 

This program should be used in eclipse or Command Line.
